 Zipping a directory kinda turns it into a file, but what if you want to turn a file into a directory system?...
 
 This is a useless tool that turns a file into a directory structure full of other files and then attempts to decode this mess back into the original file.
 
 If zipping up a directory is compression I guess this is expansion??? Obfuscation??? Over-Inflation????
